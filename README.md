Rich Header
===========

The original code comes from [this blog post](http://trendystephen.blogspot.com/2008/01/rich-header.html#sources).

```
    The Rich header is that bit of data in a Portable Executable (PE) File that follows
    the DOS Stub, but preceeds the actual PE Header. It's format is only documented
    in a handfull of places on the searchable net, and that documentation isn't terribly
    in-depth.
```
